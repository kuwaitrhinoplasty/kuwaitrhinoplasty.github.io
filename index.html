Rhinoplasty Surgery – Procedures,
Challenges and Recovery</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Rhinoplasty</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Rhinoplasty,
also known as ‘nose job’ in common terms is a
corrective plastic surgery to mend any deformity of the nose. The
surgery is
performed to give the patient a good looking nose which fits his
overall facial
characteristics.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoplasty" rel="nofollow">Nose
job</a>
has been carried out since ancient times where
beauty and facial aesthetics were of prime importance to the people.
The term
has originated from the Greek word ‘rhino’ meaning nose and ‘plast’
meaning to operate.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The Greeks have
been known for their beauty and the
aesthetic values throughout the world since ages. The term ‘Greek nose’
has originated
from Greece which means the perfect nose with perfectly aligned
features.
Surprisingly, the Greeks do no associate with this term much.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>People all
around the world with varied ethnicities vie for
the Greek nose and often times ask their surgeons to get unrealistic
results.
Although it is possible to some extent to correct the nasal features,
the
patient has to understand that there are many factors which inhibit the
surgeon
from getting the desired results.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<h2>The Problems Corrected by Nose Job</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Nose job is
recommended for those with functional
deformities and inadequacies leading to health issues. <a
 href="http://www.entnet.org/content/deviated-septum"
 rel="nofollow">Deviated
septum</a> is a
medical condition where the inner nasal wall separating the nostrils is
misaligned causing breathing and other respiratory conditions. </big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>It is also
performed on those with severe sinusitis, asthma
and chronic bronchitis to soothe the inflammation and ease their
discomfort and
help them breathe freely.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The surgery can
correct various cosmetic defects like humps
and bumps on the nasal bridge, hooked, flat, crooked, upturned or
celestial
nose. The surgery can reduce bulbous nose or can add volume to a
skeletal nasal
profile. It can also strengthen a weak dorsum which portrays a deformed
and
droopy nose. Any accidents, wounds, infections or congenital defects
can also
be corrected through this operation. </big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>An
unsatisfactory primary nose job leads the patient to go
for a revision Rhinoplasty. Here, the surgeon either does a
full-fledged
invasive surgery to correct the mistakes or uses non-surgical
injectable filler
substances to fill in the deficiencies and places left out during the
primary
Rhinoplasty. In this way the patient can be given a new and healthier
looking
nose boosting his overall self-image and confidence.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big> </big></big></p>
<h2>Who Can Perform this Surgery?</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Nose job is a
complex and delicate procedure requiring keen
observation and understanding of the structure of the nose. Every case
is unique
posing new challenges to the surgeon. The surgeon has to adjust his
procedures accordingly
and achieve the best results possible for any given case.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The surgeon has
to maintain a balance between the aesthetics
and the functional aspects of the nose. He has to try and get results
in such
way that the patient is happy with the shape and size of his nose and
yet it
suits his overall facial features and ethnic background.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This surgery is
performed by an experienced plastic surgeon
having years of experience in the field of medicine and surgery. The
surgeon
should be a practicing cosmetic surgeon with valid license from the
medical
board of his/her country. He should be permitted from the Government
and the
Medical Authority of his country to perform surgeries on the patient.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The surgical
facility or the clinic where he performs the
surgeries should be accredited by the Government and should hold valid
license
for use of surgical instrument, medicine and any substance used for
providing
health care to patients.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The surgeon
should also have a positive track record of many
successful <a
 href="http://www.americanboardcosmeticsurgery.org/patient-resources/cosmetic-surgery-vs-plastic-surgery/"
 rel="nofollow">plastic
surgeries</a> proving his metal to the prospective patients. As
the results of this surgery are instantly visible to everyone, there is
no room
for error by the surgeon. The patients usually do a thorough background
check
on the surgeon before committing with him for the surgery.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<h2>Funding the Rhinoplasty Surgery</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The expenses
vary widely throughout the world for this
surgery. The patient is required to plan and accumulate the funds in
advance.
It is also advisable to keep a buffer stock of funds in case of some
unduly
emergencies during the surgery leading to increase in the overall costs.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The overall
costs of a nasal operation can range between
<span style="font-weight: bold;">$7000 and $10000</span>.
If you are flying to other place for the surgery, the costs
of travelling and staying will add up to it along with other taxes
levied upon
you by the Government and medical authorities of that country.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The experience
of the surgeon directly affects the costs of
the surgery. More the experience more will be his fees. But, you can be
assured
that you will get the best results possible for you money. It is best
to not
compromise on this aspect while deciding about Rhinoplasty.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The physical
location of the surgical unit or clinic also
adds up the overall costs of surgery. If you opt for surgery in a big
city you
will be bound to pay higher costs for everything ranging from
travelling to
medical services and taxes.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>In certain
cases the operation gets complicated and will
require the expert advice from other highly experienced surgeons. This
will add
up to the costs of consulting with them. Any special procedure like
cartilage
harvesting and grafting will also add up the overall costs.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>As the nose
goes through surgeries the structure becomes
weaker and weaker to take any more surgical incisions. This makes it
difficult
for the surgeon to perform revision Rhinoplasty. He has to make special
arrangements
for supporting the weak nasal structure in order to achieve the desired
results.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Any
complications arising during the surgery and emergency
procedures carried out to control the situation will also add up to the
overall
cost of surgery. Therefore, it is wise to save up on the funds required
and
keep a buffer stock away in case it is required.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>
<h2>Procedure for Rhinoplasty Surgery</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Depending on
whether it is a normal Rhinoplasty surgery or a
non surgical approach, the procedure differs. In the non surgical nose
job the
surgeon uses filler agents and injects them into the subcutaneous
regions of
the nose to achieve the desired structure. This procedure is quite
simple and
takes about 15 to 20 minutes. The patient can walk out after a brief
period of
rest and can resume his day to day activities immediately.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A surgical
Rhinoplasty requires a thorough preparation by
the surgeon and the patient. The procedure involves pre-surgery medical
checkups, administering of anesthesia, making the incisions, accessing
nasal
structure, correcting any functional and cosmetic defects, securing the
new
structure, closing the incisions and finally securing the entire nose
with
splints placed inside as well as on the nostrils.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>
<h2>Recovery from Nose Job</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The patient is
required to take complete rest for the first
few weeks when the wound is still live and is healing. He is advised
against
any strenuous activity which may put pressure on the delicate nasal
walls. </big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The patient
also has to frequently clean any fluids oozing
out from the nostrils and has to keep his head in a higher position
compared to
the rest of the body while sleeping. This keeps the blood from rushing
to the
head and causing pressure on the nose.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>There are chances of
blood pooling inside the nasal cavities and causing <a
 href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4439718/"
 rel="nofollow">hematoma</a>.
Therefore, the
patient has to keep a check on bleeding by cleaning frequently and
avoiding any
post-surgical infection.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The nose will
start taking new shape over the weeks and will
completely settle in into the new structure within a year. You can
resume your
day to day activities with light exertion after a few weeks when the
bleeding
has stopped.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<h2>Final Words on Rhinoplasty Surgery</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Rhinoplasty has
been giving new hope to patients who felt
low and were always conscious and embarrassed about their looks in the
social
circles. This renewed confidence and an increase in self-worth leads
the people
to achieve greater things in their career, relationships, business and
life in
general. </big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>If you are
conscious about the way your nose looks or are
just unhappy about certain aspect of your nasal structure, this is the
right
time for consulting with your surgeon and deciding on the dates for
going
through the surgery. If you have done your research properly on the
surgeon and
the time of the year for surgery, you will reap the rewards of a
perfectly
fitting nose to your facial traits.</big></big></p>
